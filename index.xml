      <description>My name is Jason, nice to meet you!
I started my product management career at Vodafone building M-PESA in multiple African markets. The service created a new business model for mobile operators.
Afterwards, I moved to Skrill / Paysafe and learnt about marketplaces, card and alternative payments, CRMs and leading agile teams. I enjoyed working with our international teams in Bulgaria and Canada.
I had an exciting year as Head of Product with the M-KOPA Solar teams in UK and Nairobi, Kenya.</description>

      <description>You can only launch once, so do it right
With PalmPay live in Nigeria and Ghana live and 4 more African markets inflight, here are some lessons from my experience over the last 2 years.
1. Do your research I know this might appear obvious, but understanding the market landscape before you start gives you the power to make better long term decisions.
Spending time early on to get this right will direct your strategy and give your project plan a strong foundation.</description>
